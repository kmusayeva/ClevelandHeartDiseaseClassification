## Description

This project concerns statistical/epidemiological analysis and predictive modeling of Cleveland heart disease data.
The dataset contains clinical and test data of 303 patients referred for coronary angiography at the Cleveland Clinic between May 1981 and September 1984. 
This is a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict the presence or absence of heart disease.


 ## Modeling
  
 Predictive models used are logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, extreme gradient boosting and H20 AutoML for stacking. According to accuracy, AUC, F1 measures, Matthiews correlation coefficient, sensitivity and specifity, the superior performing model is logistic regression. Being a simple parametric model it is highly interpretable, making it very suitable for health datasets.
